This is about my Introduction to Graph Theory course on Coursera . This course has strengthened my
understanding of key concepts such as vertices, edges, graph connectivity, and network
flows. I'm excited to apply this concepts in real world applications and further enhance
my problem-solving and analytical skills in computer science.
